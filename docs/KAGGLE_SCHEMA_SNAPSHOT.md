| 5 | Alpine wind jkt - On high ridges, steep ice and anything alpine, this jacket serves as a true "best of all worlds" staple. It excels as a stand-alone shell for blustery rock climbs, cool-weather trail runs and high-output ski tours. And then, when conditions have you ice and alpine climbing, it functions as a lightly insulated windshirt on the approach, as well as a frictionless midlayer when it's time to bundle up and tie-in. The polyester ripstop shell with a Deluge DWR (durable water repellent) treatment sheds snow and blocks wind, while the smooth, lightly brushed hanging mesh liner wicks moisture, dries fast, and doesn't bind to your baselayers. Superlight stretch-woven underarm panels enhance breathability and allow for unimpaired arm motion, and the two hand pockets close with zippers. A drawcord hem, elastic cuffs, a heat-transfer reflective logo and a regular-coil, center-front zipper with DWR finish round out the features. Updated this season for an improved fit.
